## Customer C: Maria (Los Angeles, California)

### Can ShopGhana Process Deletion Immediately?

**No.** ShopGhana cannot immediately process Maria's deletion request under CCPA/CPRA.

**Reason:** Under the CCPA/CPRA, a business must first verify the consumer's identity and then determine whether an exception to deletion applies. Because Maria has an active return dispute, the law permits ShopGhana to retain the personal information strictly necessary to complete that transaction or to exercise/defend legal claims.

### Response to "Stop Selling" Request

ShopGhana must promptly honor Maria's opt-out, stop selling or sharing her personal data, update systems and partners, and confirm completion to her without penalizing her for making the request.

1. Verify Maria's identity
2. Process opt-out request immediately
3. Notify all third parties to stop sale/sharing
4. Assess deletion request against exceptions
5. Retain only data necessary for active dispute
6. Delete all other data not covered by exceptions
7. Disclose required information to Maria
8. Complete within 45 calendar days
